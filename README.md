# String Story Monorepo

**String Story** is a toolkit for managing and editing app localization in Flutter (inside your production app!)

## Packages

This repository contains two main packages:

- [`string_story`](./packages/string_story): The runtime package to add to your Flutter app, providing an in-app locale editor and story-based translation coverage.
- [`string_story_utils`](./packages/string_story_utils): A set of developer tools and code generators to streamline string management and localization workflows.

## Example

A complete Flutter app example is available in [`packages/string_story/example`](./packages/string_story/example). This demonstrates how to integrate and use String Story in your own projects.

## Getting Started

Each package contains its own README with setup instructions. For a quick start, see the example app and follow the steps in the `string_story` package.

Contributions are welcome! Please see the [`justfile`](./justfile) for useful commands to build, test, and maintain the repo.
